5,000 Leagues From Home
by Christopher J. Teuton

<br>5KLFH is an Oregon Trail-like game where players must safely guide their ship through unsafe waters back home.
<br>You will need to balance your ship's health and crew rations, along with your own money, to make it home alive. Money can be found through random events, by sending out scout boats, or by exploring islands and talking to locals.
<br>Random encounters can occure both on the open water and at the islands you visit. There are multiple storylines to uncover, and it is impossible to see all of them in a single playthrough. It's a good idea to search islands and talk to locals whenever possible. 
<br>Deploy search boats to scavenge for loot and rations. You can send out as many search boats as you want while on the open water, but you are vulnerable while waiting for them to return.
<br>Ships can be repaired on the open ocean, but it will cost some Crew Rations for the effort. Professional ship repair can be done at ports, but will cost some loot.
<br>During travel your rations and ship health are constantly ticking down, so don't get idle! Islands are located roughly 190 leagues apart, and you want to make sure you have enough rations and ship health to make the journey.
<br>Good luck!
