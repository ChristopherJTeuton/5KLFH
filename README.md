# 5kFLH
5,000 Leagues From Home
by Christopher J. Teuton

5KLFH is an Oregon Trail-like game where players must safely guide their ship, the S.S. Slugdog, through unsafe waters back home.
Players will need to balance their ship's health and crew rations, along with their own money.
Random encounters can occure both on the open water and at the islands you visit. 
It's a good idea to search islands and talk to locals whenever possible.
Deploy search boats to scavenge for loot and supplies.
Ships can be repaired on the open ocean, but it will cost some Crew Rations for the effort. Ship repair can also be done at ports.
During travel your rations and ship health are constantly ticking down, so don't get idle!
Good luck!
